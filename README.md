comparative-analysis for source apportionment
====================

Comparative analysis of environmental data from source apportionment

This project is about comparative analysis of environmental data coming out from source apportionment analysis.

The comparison is made between the results found by several laboratories that carried out source apportionment on a common database.

The output of source apportionment runs are:
- factor profiles (pollutant factors)
- uncertainties of factor profiles
- time trends of factor profiles
- factor contributions to a given chemical species
